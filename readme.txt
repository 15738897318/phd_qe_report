Hi Nicholas, 

Finally, this is the 1st version of my QE report. 
Also, latex source code and document converted source is included. 

Next version, I will update: 
* some blurring figures and tables 
* the conclusion chapter (This version does NOT contain the conclusion)
* small error in words grammar

Now some figures are lost because of Github crash!!
Fortunately, the published introduction contains all the updated information, except for little re-phrase required text. 
So now you pick out the new pics and text from introduction.doc, to latex source
