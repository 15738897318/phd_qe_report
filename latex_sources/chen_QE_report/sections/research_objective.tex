As a novel paradigm for signal processing and acquisition, the compressive sensing or compressed sensing (CS) technique, is identified to have great potential for resolving the problems mentioned above. The CS theory has been proven to be suitable for numerous computer science and electronic engineering based applications, where it is possible to overcome the limitation of the traditional sampling theory. The main idea of the research work is to further extend the CS based techniques to embedded signal processing systems. Using this approach, a novel CS-based framework for embedded signal processing systems will be proposed that encompass various areas such as data compression, data acquisition, data storage, data transmission optimal recovery and processing, but targeted for embedded deployment. In addition, since embedded signal processing system are popular and suitable in many wireless network applications such as battery supplied mobile devices, we would also focus on CS techniques that will be particularly effective for wireless communication. This report first introduces the basis of CS framework, follows by recent works performed on CS-based ADCs and CS-UWB positioning sytems. It then discusses potential research directions, particularly in the area of CS-wireless communication that would be especially benefited by the CS techniques.
