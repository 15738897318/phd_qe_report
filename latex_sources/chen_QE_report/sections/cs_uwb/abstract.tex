Ultra-wide band (UWB) indoor positioning always suffers from extremely high-rate signal detection. The compressive sensing (CS), which is considered as the optimal solution of acquisition and reconstruction for sparse signals, provides an alternative solution by implementing random projection at transmitters or receivers. However, these CS based UWB positioning systems still cannot avoid high-rate mixing operation when generating the PN sequence during random projection. In this paper, we propose a new CS based UWB positioning system to solve this problem, which implements a relatively low-rate random pre-mixing at the transmitter and correspondingly sub-Nyquist rate sampling at receivers. As a result, the new system successfully eliminates the extremely high Nyquist rate in the system by sacrifices a small degree of compression ratio. Simulation results demonstrate the new system maintains outstanding performance in terms of positioning accuracy.
