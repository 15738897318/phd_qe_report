Over the past few decades, digital signal processings have been widely deployed in many computational applications in areas such as image processing, video conferencing, smart sensors network, and other real-time processing technologies. These applications are also increasingly being implemented in embedded systems such as mobile and wireless devices, aerospace equipment, and biomedical instruments etc. 

Many signal processing systems also involve signal sampling and conversion, where one of the most crucial limitations lies in the sampling theory (the Nyquist sampling rate or Shannon theory, which states the minimum two time sampling rate requirement.) Due to limited data processing and storing capability found in many embedded systems, excessive data samples will negatively affect their performance and power efficiency, and hence forms the bottleneck of entire digital systems. As such, overcoming the sampling rate limitation has become a prevailing research topic, and would be of particular significance for embedded signal processing systems.
